# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We value security for the project very highly. We encourage all users to report any vulnerabilities they discover to us.
If you find a security vulnerability in the Keploy project, please report it responsibly by sending an email 
to c.parpart@lastrada.net or support@lastrada.net.

> ***WARNING!*** DO NOT use the issue tracker or discuss it in the public forum as it will cause more damage than help.

At this point, we don't have a bug bounty program, we are a small team trying to solve a big problem.
We urge you to report any vulnerabilities responsibly so that we can continue building a secure application for the entire community.
